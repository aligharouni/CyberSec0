# Food For Thoughts:

## A review of works on risk indices in the field
- what is been done?

## Ideas
- Does it make sense to combine multiple indices? How to average multiple indices? 
- Does pointwise or functional statistics make sense?
  - One idea is: the risk is a function of time. Also, there is a autocorrelation in the risk, ie, the bad guys learn from past and build their new threads upon that. The question is that "does the risk index capture this autocorrelation?"
- Is there any statistical analysis been done on risk indies with data comparison?
  - where is data? (see data section below)
  - what statistical analysis would make sense?
  
- Risk assessment on a network from a modelling perspective:
a) A network of connected PCs, servers, endpoints, etc can be thought of a connected graph, with a certain network topology
b) A Malware/virus ... can be thought of as an infected node in the graph
c) the Math theory of this scenario has been well developed and I have been working on it too,
d) this model can  be simulated and the output would be the infected nodes after time t

- LinkedIn Data analysis:
  - sources: (i)<https://rpubs.com/phylliswany/98000>, (ii) <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rlinkedin/>  what is this package?
  - 2 potential things to be considered:
    - career suggestion analysis
    - Automating LinkedIn profile/connection management (ie., sorting, connecting, reconnecting to people, etc.)

## Data

- [Multi-Label Dataset of Internet Traffics (MLDIT)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/artemis1216/multi-label-dataset-of-internet-traffics)
  - (This belongs to ideas) Thinking of using statistical methods/ML techniques to do feature analysis, clustering, learning from data and do behavioral predictions, anomaly analysis towards risk identifications (parameteric/non parametric)
