# Food For Thoughts:

## A review of works on risk indices in the field.
- what is been done?
- Does it make sense to combine multiple indices? How to average multiple indices? 
- Does pointwise or functional statistics make sense?
  - One idea is: the risk is a function of time. Also, there is a autocorrelation in the risk, ie, the bad guys learn from past and build their new threads upon that. The question is that "does the risk index capture this autocorrelation?"
- Is there any statistical analysis been done on risk indies with data comparison?
  - where is data?
  - what statistical analysis would make sense?
